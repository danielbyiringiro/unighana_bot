Scholarship Selection

The selection process begins by determining whether a student qualifies to be admitted into Ashesi, based on each applicantâ€™s overall profile. The initial selection process is need-blind.
Applicants who qualify to enter Ashesi, and applied for scholarships, are then evaluated on the basis of their financial need; at this stage, a thorough assessment is made of all applicant information gathered by the Scholarship Committee, which is made up of the entire admissions team. Where information provided is unclear, students may be asked additional questions on their financial need during their Admissions interview.
Based on the proven financial need, applicants are placed into one of four categories: Extreme Need, High Need, Medium Need or Low Need. For each category of aid, there is a set amount of funding Ashesi can award, or a set amount of named scholarships assigned. Students in each category are then ranked based on the strength of their admissions application; funding is awarded to students in each category based on this ranking, until the allocated funds run out for the admissions period. 
Students within each category who do not immediately receive funds, are then placed on a waitlist, and informed of their status. Should an accepted student decline a scholarship offer, the offer is then passed on to the next student on the waitlist. Students who receive scholarships at Ashesi typically demonstrate that they would be;
Able to successfully complete academic work at Ashesi.
Otherwise unable to afford to attend Ashesi.
Active contributors to campus life and culture.
Committed to giving back to their communities and showing strong leadership potential.
