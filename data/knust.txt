Overview

Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) is a world-class academic center of excellence, spearheading West Africa‚Äôs pursuit of technological advancement. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology is the public university established in the country, as well as the largest university in the Kumasi Metropolis and in the Ashanti Region.
 
In November 2019, KNUST was ranked as the best university in Ghana and West Africa by U.S. News & World Report. It was also ranked 14th in Africa and 706th in the world, with a global score of 42.4.  In November 2020 it was ranked the best for the second time by U.S. News & World Report. This time it climbed 2 positions to be 12th best in Africa.
‚Äã
KNUST has, since January 2005, transformed from its previous centralized system of administration into a decentralized collegiate university. Under this system, the faculties have been condensed into six colleges. The colleges are semi-autonomous, which means that they are given the power to largely run on their own without much dependence on the central administration for financial support. 
‚Äã
There are numerous KNUST-approved hostels, mostly in close proximity to the main campus. Students of all financial backgrounds have their accommodation needs catered for. There are six halls of residence at the Kumasi campus, each administered by a hall council consisting of senior and junior members. There are few hostels on campus like the GUSS hostel, Brunei, and Tek credit hostel. The executive head is the hall master, who is assisted by a senior tutor. There is a hall bursar and other supporting staff.
